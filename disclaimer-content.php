			Data provided on this Site may be delayed as specified by financial

			The featured stock content and this newsletter is not an offer to 
			sell any securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy any 
			securities or conduct investment business. Information provided in 
			the Service is for reference purposes only and does not represent 
			itself to be offering or recommending any securities to be bought or 
			sold . It should not be regarded as a recommendation that any 
			investment is suitable for a particular investor. We are neither 
			brokers nor stock advisors. The service is provided as a guide to 
			some available OTC investments only, which must be tempered by the 
			investment experience and independent decision making process of the 
			subscriber. <br>
			<br>
			This publication is a paid advertisement on behalf of the said 
			company and should not be construed as investment advice. This 
			newsletter is not to a complete analysis of the company mentioned.
			<br>
			<br>
			The accuracy of issuer documents and information that is submitted 
			to WindStocks.info for inclusion on this site is principally 
			the responsibility of the particular issuer and its management. 
			WindStocks.info is neither responsible for, nor undertakes any 
			steps to check, the accuracy of any information provided by featured 
			OTC companies to potential investors. You should confirm to your own 
			satisfaction the veracity of any information prior to entering into 
			any investment. The information on this site is not designed to be 
			used as the basis for an investment decision. <br>
			<br>
			Certain statements in this site are &quot;forward-looking statements&quot; and 
			are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and 
			uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, 
			changes in the law or regulations, demand for products and services 
			of the company, the effects of competition and other factors that 
			could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
			or represented in the forward looking statements. Forward-looking 
			statements are typically identified by the words: believe, expect, 
			anticipate, intend, estimate, and similar expressions or which by 
			their nature refer to future events. <br>
			<br>
			The decision to buy or sell any security that may be featured in the 
			WindStocks.info Service is done purely at the subscriber's own 
			risk. Under no circumstances will its owners, officers, or employees 
			be held liable for any losses incurred by the use of information 
			contained in the Service. The risk factor is high in stock trading 
			and only &quot;Risk Capital&quot; or &quot;Risk Funds&quot; should be used in such 
			trading. A person who does not have extra Risk Capital, or Risk 
			Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in the market.
			<br>
			<br>
			No &quot;SAFE&quot; trading system has ever been devised and no one, including 
			us, can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. The past results of 
			any trading or investment recommendations are not necessarily 
			indicative of future performance. <br>
			<br>
			Investing in OTC securities is speculative and carries a high degree 
			of risk. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Readers 
			should consult with their own independent tax, business and 
			financial advisors with respect to any investment, including any 
			contemplated investment in the featured companies. All information 
			contained in this newsletter advertisement should be independently 
			verified with the advertised company and any independent financial 
			analyst. You should independently investigate and fully understand 
			all risks before investing. <br>
			<br>
			Many OTC securities are relatively illiquid, or &quot;thinly traded,&quot; 
			which can enhance volatility in the share price and make it 
			difficult for investors to buy or sell without dramatically 
			affecting the quoted price or may be unable to sell a position at a 
			later date. <br>
			<br>
			Due to the nature of the companies and the OTC markets, it may prove 
			difficult for an investor to obtain reliable information about the 
			value of an investment, the prospects of a particular company and 
			any particular risks that company or an investment may be exposed 
			to. <br>
			<br>
			Requirements for the initial quotation of and continuing obligations 
			of securities quoted on the Pink Sheets or the Over-the-Counter 
			Bulletin Board (OTC BB) are not as high as for companies whose 
			shares are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a stock exchange 
			where there are mandatory listing rules and continuing obligations. 
			Unlike the NASD OTC Bulletin Board, issuers of stock listed on the 
			Pink Sheets do not have to be reporting companies with the SEC. 
			Quotation of a security in the Pink Sheets or the Yellow Sheets does 
			not in itself create any ongoing filing or reporting obligations 
			with the SEC or the NASD for the Issuer. <br>
			<br>
			WindStocks.info is not a NASD Broker/Dealer. Investors must 
			contact a NASD Broker/Dealer to trade in a security featured in 
			WindStocks.info. <br>
			<br>
			WindStocks.info and/or their affiliates or agents may at any 
			time buy or sell stock in the profiled companies. <br>
			<br>
			WindStocks.info and its affiliates are not registered 
			investment advisors, analysts or broker dealers and are not members 
			of any professional group or association. We occasionally receive 
			investment information and stock analyses prepared by our clients, 
			but receive this information at face value. <br>
