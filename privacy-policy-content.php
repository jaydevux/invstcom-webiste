			<br>
			<b>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS 
			ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY </b><br>
			Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the 
			consideration required for your right to visit the website. If you

			<br>
			<b>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT 
			IS USED </b><br>
			This website routinely collects information about its visitors, 
			subscribers, members, and customers. This information is obtained in 
			various ways, such as: <br>
			<br>
			<b>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED 
			FROM 'REGISTRATION' </b><br>
			Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer 
			takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this 
			website. This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for 
			a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your 
			participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting 
			information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be 
			from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, 
			paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product. <br>
			<br>
			Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the 
			website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure 
			merchant service processing. This information is kept at the highest 
			level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the 
			merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with 
			the customer. <br>
			<br>
			<b>ONLINE ORDERING </b><br>
			Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping 
			cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and 
			Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide 
			complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, the 
			customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone 
			number, CVS (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member 
			password. You should consider all this information available to the 
			website. This information is used to deliver the product, but under 
			the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general 
			solicitation purposes. <br>
			<br>
			<b>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES </b><br>
			Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so 
			under two conditions: one, they give their permission for contact by 
			the website; two, they are subject to the general 'SUBMISSION' 
			agreement of this policy. While your email address may or may not be 
			used to solicit you, it is added to the website's general 
			solicitation database. <br>
			<br>
			<b>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS </b><br>
			If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you 
			communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects 
			information about your communication and by communicating with the 
			site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and 
			otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit. <br>
			<br>
			Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to 
			be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes. <br>
			<br>
			<b>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, 
			POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS </b><br>
			Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, 
			appearing on this website must assume that information is being 
			collected about them. This site is not responsible for the use of 
			information collected in such a fashion. Visitors must assume that 
			(1) information will be collected, (2) that 'cookies' will usually 
			be placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any 
			control over what happens with this information, (4) that website 
			takes no responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers,

			appear to come from your email. You must accept fully responsibility 
			for referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this 
			site for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results from 
			said referrals. <br>
			<br>
			<b>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER 
			OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS </b><br>
			Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any 
			information provided to the website as part of a survey in which you

			you are. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;Cookies&quot; is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your 
			hard drive. Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track 
			of search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the 
			site or use of products sold by the site. Cookies can also be used

			of your computer. <br>

			their use to benefit you. You also give permission to collect, 
			archive, retrieve, and use any information collected for product 
			design, product offers to you, and general commercial solicitation 
			purposes by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and 
			marketing organizations. <br>
